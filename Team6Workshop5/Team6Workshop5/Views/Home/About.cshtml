            <p>
                Travel Experts was incorporated in 1960 by Douglas Halliday in Calgary, Alberta.
                He recognized the need for Calgarians to take a break off work to recuperate and rejuvenate their minds and body.
                He also discovered that tourist sites in Alberta were always desolate due to lack of awareness of their existence.
                In catering to these needs, he established Travel Experts to organize tours and vacations for Calgarians and Canadians at large.
